ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zeroska

Whatâ€™s in a name? Whether you call me Zeroska or something else, what really matters is that youâ€™ve found your way here. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here, and I hope youâ€™ll find something useful on this page

My work in cybersecurity keeps me on the cutting edge of technology, while my passion lies in exploring the big questions of life through philosophy. Iâ€™m also fascinated by intelligence and business, both on a practical and theoretical level.
